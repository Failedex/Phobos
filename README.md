# PHOBOS

Was originally trying to make [this pixel art](https://x.com/Arvydas_B/status/1307207015303974912) a real thing, but then I got side tracked by many other things and ideas.

# Tools used
- Compositor: sway/swayfx
- Bar: eww
- Font: FairFaxHD

### Dependencies
- playerctl
- python i3ipc, dbus, gobject
- pamixer
- brightnessctl
- nmcli
- bluetoothctl

If there are other things missing, I'm sure you can figure it out. Good luck.
